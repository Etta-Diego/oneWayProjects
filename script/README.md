This directory contains shell scripts that document the commands executed during
the EC2 server setup, website deployment, and basic server hardening tasks
performed in this project.

The scripts are provided for documentation and reproducibility purposes, allowing
the deployment steps to be reviewed or replicated. Some scripts (such as SSH
access commands) are intended for reference only and are not meant to be executed
directly on the EC2 instance.
